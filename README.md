## Getting Started

### I. Running on Docker (Recommended)


1. From DockerHub image for a Quick Test
```bash	
docker pull yaasiinayeva/whatsbot:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 yaasiinayeva/whatsbot
```

2. From the Github Code
- After cloning the project make sure to setup your environnment variables from the `.env.example` file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Then Build your container and start your project
```bash	
docker-compose up --build -d
```

A QR code will be generated for you to scan.
Go to <a target="_blank" href="localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
Kindly scan it with your whatsapp app and you're all set! ðŸŽ‰ 


### II. Runninng Locally without docker (Not Recommended)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running locally requires you to do more configuration. This project is based on `whatsappweb.js` which uses `Pupperteer`. It requires a brower driver to work. You have to install Chrome or Chromium on your machine. Make sure the environment variables are set in the `.env` file before starting the server. The `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` should be set to your chrome/chromium browser path.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

A QR code will be generated for you to scan.
Go to <a target="_blank" href="localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
Kindly scan it with your whatsapp app and you're all set! ðŸŽ‰ 


## Configurations

You can change the configurations in `src/configs/app.config.ts`

For third-party services used in the bot, kindly get the API keys and set them correctly. These are the one used in the bot, skipping them could lead to limitations :

- [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) : AI for text completion
- [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) : ChatGPT for text completion
- [Open Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/) : Provides weather information
- [Speechify](https://console.sws.speechify.com/api-keys) : Text-to-Speech tool used in this project
- [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs) : Speech to text tool used in this project 
- [Youtube DLP Wrapper](https://github.com/foxesdocode/yt-dlp-wrap) : Video Downloader used in this project

## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, especially when it is used to spam people. So this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**

## TODO
- [x] i18n support
- [x] Add support for more translation languages
- [ ] Implement a queue system to handle multiple concurrent video download requests at the same time and make the bot more responsive
- [ ] Refactor the code to not use third-party services for speech-to-text and use `whisper-node` instead
- [ ] Add support for any kind of file download
- [ ] Implement an API for the bot
- [ ] Add more features (Open to suggestions)
